\centerline{\large Using Interrupts with C code}
~\\


The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the use of interrupts for the Nios\textsuperscript{\textregistered} II
processor, using C code. To do this exercise you need to have a good working knowledge of
the exceptions processing mechanisms of the Nios~II processor.
You should also read the information on exceptions and interrupts of the 
pre-built computer system documentation corresponding to which DE-series board you own.

~\\
This exercise involves the same tasks as those given in Exercise 5,
except that this exercise uses C code rather than assembly-language code.

\section*{Part I}
\addcontentsline{toc}{1}{Part I}
Consider the main program shown in Figure~\ref{fig:code}. The program calls a 
subroutine {\it config\_KEYs()} to initialize the pushbutton KEYs port so that it will generate
interrupts, and calls a subroutine {\it enable\_nios2\_interrupts()} to enable
interrupts in the Nios~II processor. You are to fill in the missing code for the 
subroutines. To enable interrupts the main program includes
{\it macros}, in the file "nios2\_ctrl\_reg\_macros.h", which provide access to the Nios~II
status and control registers.  Examples of useful macros that might be included 
are provided in Figure \ref{fig:macros}. 

~\\
After completing the initialization steps
described above, the main program just ``idles'' in an endless loop.
The purpose of the program is to show the numbers \red{0} to \red{3} on the {\it HEX}0
to {\it HEX}3 displays, respectively, when a corresponding pushbutton {\it KEY} is pressed. 
Since the main program only idles in a loop, the displays have to be controlled by using an 
interrupt service routine for the pushbutton KEYs port. If you are using a DE10-Lite,
you only need to show the numbers \red{0} and \red{1}, as the board has only two pushbutton KEYs.
Perform the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new folder to hold your Monitor Program project for this part. Create a
file, such as {\it part1.c}, for your main program, and create any other source-code files 
that you may wish to use.  Write the code for the subroutines that are called by the 
main program. Be sure to enable Nios~II interrupts for the pushbutton KEYs port.

\item 
The reset and exception handlers for the main program are given in Figure \ref{fig:irq_code}. 
The function called {\it the\_reset} provides a simple reset mechanism by
performing a branch to the main program. The function named {\it the\_exception} 
represents a general exception handler that can be used with any C program. It includes 
assembly language code to check if the exception is caused by an external interrupt, and, 
if so, calls a C language routine named {\it interrupt\_handler}. This routine can then 
perform whatever action is needed for the specific application. In 
Figure~\ref{fig:irq_code}, the {\it interrupt\_handler} code first 
determines which exception has occurred, by using a macro from Figure~\ref{fig:macros} 
that reads the content of the Nios II interrupt pending register. 
  
\newpage
You have to write the code for the {\it pushbutton\_isr()} interrupt service routine.
Your code should show the digit \red{0} on the {\it HEX}0 display when {\it KEY}$_0$ is
pressed, and then if {\it KEY}$_0$ is pressed again the display should be ``blank''. You should
toggle the {\it HEX}0 display between \red{0} and ``blank'' in this manner each time 
{\it KEY}$_0$ is pressed. Similarly, toggle between ``blank'' and \red{1}, \red{2}, or 
\red{3} on the {\it HEX}1 through {\it HEX}3 displays each time {\it KEY}$_1$, {\it KEY}$_2$,
or {\it KEY}$_3$ is pressed, respectively. If using a DE10-Lite, you do not need to toggle between
\red{2}/\red{3} and ``blank'' on the {\it HEX}2/{\it HEX}3 display.

\item
Make a new Monitor Program project in the folder where you stored your source-code files.
In the Monitor Program screen illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:exceptions}, make sure 
to choose {\sf Exceptions} in the {\it Linker Section Presets} drop-down menu.

\item
Compile, download, and test your program.

\section*{ Part II}
\addcontentsline{toc}{2}{Part II}
Consider the main program shown in Figure~\ref{fig:code2}. The code is required to set up 
interrupts from two sources: the Interval Timer and the pushbutton KEYs port. The main program 
calls the subroutines {\it config\_timer( )} and {\it config\_KEYS( )} to set up the two ports. 
You are to write each of these subroutines. Set up the Interval Timer to generate one interrupt
every 0.25 seconds.

~\\
In Figure~\ref{fig:code2} the main program executes an endless loop writing the value of
the global variable {\it count} to the red lights LEDR.  In the interrupt service routine for 
the Interval Timer you are to increment the variable {\it count} 
by the value of the {\it run} global variable, 
which should be either 1 or 0.  You are to toggle the value of the {\it run} global variable 
in the interrupt service routine for the pushbutton KEYs, each time a KEY is pressed.
When {\it run} = 0, the main program will display a static count on the red lights,
and when {\it run} = 1, the count shown on the red lights will increment every 0.25 seconds.
Make a new Monitor Program project for this part, and assemble, download, and test your
code.

\newpage
\section*{ Part III}
\addcontentsline{toc}{3}{Part III}
Modify your program from Part II so that you can vary the speed at which the counter
displayed on the red lights is incremented. All of your changes for this part should be made
in the interrupt service routine for the pushbutton KEYs. The main program and the rest of
your code should not be changed.

~\\
Implement the following behavior. When {\it KEY}$_0$ is pressed, the value of the {\it RUN}
variable should be toggled, as in Part I. Hence, pressing {\it KEY}$_0$ stops/runs
the incrementing of the {\it COUNT} variable. When {\it KEY}$_1$ is pressed, the rate at which
{\it COUNT} is incremented should be either increased or decreased depending on the value of {\it SW}$_0$.
If {\it SW}$_0$ is 1, then the rate should be doubled, otherwise the
rate should be halved. You should implement this feature by stopping the Interval Timer within
the pushbutton KEYs interrupt service routine, modifying the load value used in the
timer, and then restarting the timer.

\section*{ Part IV}
\addcontentsline{toc}{4}{Part IV}
For this part you are to create a real-time clock that is shown on the seven-segment displays {\it HEX}$5-0$.
Set up an interval timer to provide an interrupt every 1/100 of a second. Use this
timer to increment a global variable called {\it time}. You should use the {\it time} variable as your real time clock.
Use the format \red{MM}:\red{SS}:\red{DD}, where \red{\it MM} are minutes, \red{\it SS} are seconds and \red{\it DD} are hundredths of a second.
When the clock reaches \red{59}:\red{59}:\red{99}, it should wrap around to \red{00}:\red{00}:\red{00}.

~\\
Make a new folder to hold your Monitor Program project for this part. Write the program for the
real-time clock. To show the {\it TIME} variable in the real-time clock format
\red{\it MM}:\red{SS}:\red{DD}, you can use the same approach that was followed for Part 4 of Lab Exercise 4.
In that previous exercise you used polled I/O with the Interval Timer,
whereas now you are using interrupts. One possible way to structure your code is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:code3}. The endless loop in this code writes the value of a variable named
{\it HEX\_code} to the {\it HEX}$3-0$ displays.

~\\
Using the scheme in Figure~\ref{fig:code3}, the interrupt service routine for the second 
Interval Timer has to increment the {\it TIME} variable, and also update
the {\it HEX\_code} variable that is being written to the 7-segment displays by the main program.

~\\
Make a new Monitor Program project and test your code.
