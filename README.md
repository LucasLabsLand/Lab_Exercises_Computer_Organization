# Computer Organization Laboratory Exercises

These laboratory exercises progress through the fundamentals concepts that are taught in Computer Organization courses, 
including assembly-language code, different types of instructions and addressing modes, memory, stacks, subroutines, 
interrupts, and C code.

Each exercise consists of multiple parts that build upon one another in a modular fashion. The exercises make use of 
various input/output devices to perform experiments that are both interesting and pedagogically valuable.

There are different versions of the laboratory exercises for both the ARM and Nios II processor. The Standard variation 
supports the features of the DE1-SoC, DE10-Standard, and DE10-Lite boards, while the Nano variation is for the DE10-Nano 
board.
