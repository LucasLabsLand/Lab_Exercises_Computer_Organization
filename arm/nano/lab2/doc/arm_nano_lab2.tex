\centerline{\large Using Logic Instructions with the ARM* Processor}
~\\

\noindent
Logic instructions are needed in many embedded applications.  Logic instructions are useful 
for manipulation of bit strings and for dealing with data at the bit level where only a 
few bits may be of special interest.  They are essential in dealing with input/output tasks.
In this exercise we will consider some typical uses.
We will use the ARM* processor in the DE10-Nano or DE0-Nano-SoC Computer.

~\\
\noindent
{\bf Part I}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
In this part you will implement an ARM assembly language program that counts the longest 
string of 1's in a word of data. For example, if the word of data is {\sf 0x103fe00f}, then 
the required result is 9.

~\\
\noindent
Perform the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new folder to hold your solution for this part. Create a
file called {\it part1.s}, and type the assembly language code shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:code} into this
file. This code uses an algorithm involving shift and AND operations to find the required 
result---make sure that you understand how this works.

\caption{Assembly-language program that finds the largest string of 1's.}
\label{fig:code}
\end{figure}

\item
Make a new Monitor Program project in the folder where you stored the {\it part1.s}
file. Use the DE10-Nano or DE0-Nano-SoC Computer for this project.
\item
Compile and load the program. Fix any errors that you encounter (if you mistyped some of
the code). Once the program is loaded into memory in your DE-series board, single step
through the code to see how the program works.
\end{enumerate}
\
\noindent
{\bf Part II}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
Perform the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a new folder and make a copy of the file {\it part1.s} in that new folder. Give
the new file a name such as {\it part2.s}.
\item In the new file {\it part2.s}, take the code which calculates the 
number of consecutive 1's and make it into a subroutine called ONES. Have the subroutine use 
register R1 to receive the input data and register R0 for returning the result.
\item Add more words in memory starting from the label TEST\_NUM. You can add as many
words as you like, but include at least 10 words. To terminate the list include the word 0
at the end---check for this 0 entry in your main program to determine when all of the
items in the list have been processed.
\item In your main program, call the newly-created subroutine in a loop for every word of 
data that you placed in memory. Keep track of the longest string of 1's in any of the words, 
and have this result in register R5 when your program completes execution. 
\item Make sure to use breakpoints or single-stepping in the Monitor Program to observe what 
happens each time the ONES subroutine is called.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
{\bf Part III}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
One might be interested in the longest string of 0's, or even the longest string of
alternating 1's and 0's. For example, the binary number {\sf 101101010001} has a string of 
6 alternating 1's and 0's.
~\\

\noindent Write a new assembly language program that determines the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Longest string of 1's in a word of data---put the result into register R5
\item Longest string of 0's in a word of data---put the result into register R6
\item Longest string of alternating 1's and 0's in a word of data---put the result into 
register R7
(Hint: What happens when an n-bit number is XORed with an n-bit string of alternating 0's and 1's?)
\end{itemize}
Make each calculation in a separate subroutine called ONES, ZEROS, and ALTERNATE. Call
each of these subroutines in the loop that you wrote in Part II, and keep track of the
largest result for each calculation, from your list of data.

\newpage
\noindent
{\bf Part IV}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
In this part you are to extend your code from Part III so that the results produced are
shown on the Terminal window of the \productNameMedTM{}.
Each result should be displayed as a two-digit decimal number preceded by the name of the register
the number corresponds to. You may want to use the approach discussed in Part IV of Exercise 1 to
convert the numbers in registers R5, R6, and R7 from binary to decimal.  

~\\
\noindent
The DE-series board can communicate with the \productNameMed{}'s Terminal through the 
JTAG* UART.  The programming interface of the JTAG UART consists of two 32-bit registers, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:UART}. The register mapped to address 0xFF201000 is called the 
{\it Data} register and the register mapped to address 0xFF201004 is called the {\it
Control} register.

~\\
\noindent
The JTAG UART includes a 64-character FIFO that stores data waiting to be transmitted to the 
host computer.  ASCII character data is loaded into this FIFO by performing a write to 
bits 7-0 of the Data register in Figure~\ref{fig:UART}. Note that writing into this register 
has no effect on received data. The amount of space, WSPACE, currently available in
the transmit FIFO is provided in bits 31-16 of the Control register. If the transmit FIFO 
is full, then any characters written to the Data register will be lost. A subroutine that 
transmits a character to the host computer is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:jtag_out}.

\caption{A subroutine that sends an ASCII character to the Monitor Program Terminal.}
\label{fig:jtag_out}
\end{figure}

\noindent
An example of code that shows the contents of registers on the Terminal window
is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:codefrag}. The code in the figure shows only the steps needed 
to display the contents of register R5 on the Terminal. Extend the code to display the contents of 
all three registers.

\label{fig:codefrag}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\noindent
For your Monitor Program project for this part, in the screen shown in Figure
\ref{fig:terminal}, make sure to select {\sf JTAG\_UART\_for\_ARM\_0} as the {\it Terminal
device}. Without this setting no character output will appear on the Terminal window when 
your code writes to the JTAG UART.
