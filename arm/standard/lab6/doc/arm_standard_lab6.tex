\centerline{\large Using C code with the ARM* Processor}
~\\

\noindent
This is an exercise in using C code with the ARM* processor.  We will use 
the {\it \productNameMedTM{}} software to compile, load, and run application programs
written in the C language.  In this exercise you have to be familiar with both the C language 
and the ARM assembly language.  You should read the parts of the Monitor Program tutorial that 
discuss the use of C code. This tutorial can be accessed from Intel's FPGA University Program 
website, or by selecting {\sf Help $>$ Tutorial} within the Monitor Program software.
We assume that you are using either the DE1-SoC or DE10-Standard Computer system to
implement your solutions. You need to be familiar with a number of I/O ports in these
systems, including the parallel ports connected to various lights and switches, as well as 
the ARM A9 Private Timer port. These I/O ports are described in the documentation for 
the computer system.

{\bf Part I}

~\\
\noindent
In Exercise 1, Part II, you were given a program in the ARM assembly language that finds the 
largest number in a list of 32-bit integers that is stored in the memory.  This code is 
reproduced in Figure~\ref{fig:code}. For this exercise you are to write a C-language program 
that implements this task.  Perform the following steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Write your C code in a file called {\it part1.c}.  You should use the {\it printf}
library function to display the result produced by the program. To use the {\it printf} function 
you have to include the {\it stdio.h} library header file in your C program by using the statement

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdio.h>
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
To include a list of data words in the C program, you can declare them as an array using
a statement such as

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int LIST[8] = {7, 4, 5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 2}; // number of elements, element 1,
                                        // element 2, ...
\end{lstlisting}

\item
Make a new Monitor Program project for 
this part of the exercise. In the Monitor Program screen shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:MPprogtype} select {\sf C Program} in the {\it Program Type}
dropdown menu, and on the screen that follows select your {\it part1.c} file. In the screen of 
Figure~\ref{fig:MPterminal} set the {\it Terminal device} to {\sf Semihosting}.
This setting causes the output of the {\it printf} library function to appear 
in the {\it Terminal} window of the Monitor Program graphical user interface.

~\\
\noindent
Compile and download your program. Examine the disassembled code and compare it
to the code shown in Figure~\ref{fig:code}. To see the assembly code corresponding to your 
C source code, use the {\bf Goto instruction} dialog box in the Monitor Program's Disassembly
window. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MPgoto}, type {\sf main} in the dialog box and then 
click on the {\sf Go} button to display your code. When you run the program, the results
produced by the {\it printf} function should appear in the {\it Terminal} window as indicated 
in the figure.

\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:code}
\end{figure}

~\\
\noindent
{\bf Part II}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
Using the {\it printf} function results in a fairly large number of assembly-language instructions,
because C library routines like {\it printf} are quite complex. Modify your program to display the 
result on the red lights {\it LEDR}, instead of using the {\it printf} statement. The
parallel port in the DE-series Computer connected to the red lights is memory-mapped at the 
address {\sf 0xFF200000}, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:LEDR}.

~\\
\noindent
Compile, download, and run this program. Observe the difference in the size of the
machine code for this program as compared to the one from Part I.

\noindent
{\bf Part III}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
In Exercise 2 you were given a program that uses shift and AND operations to find the
longest string of 1's in a word of data. The program is reproduced in
Figure~\ref{fig:shiftAND}.  In Parts III and IV of Exercise 2 you were asked to extend
this program so that it processed a list of data words, rather than just one word. Also,
the program was extended to compute the longest
strings of 1's, the longest string of 0's, and the longest string of alternating 1's and 0's
for any of the words in the list. The results of these computations were to be shown 
on the 7-segment displays in the DE-series Computer. For this part of the exercise, you are 
to write a C-language program to implement these tasks.

\lstinputlisting[style=defaultArmStyle]{../design_files/part3.s}
\end{center}
\caption{Assembly-language program that counts consecutive ones.}
\label{fig:shiftAND}
\end{figure}

~\\
\noindent
To include the list of data words in your C program, you can declare them as an array using
a statement such as

\noindent
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int TEST_NUM[ ] = {0x0000e000, 0x3fabedef, 0x00000001, 0x00000002, 0x75a5a5a5,
                   0x01ffC000, 0x03ffC000, 0x55555555, 0x77777777, 0x08888888,
                   0x00000000};
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Display the count for the longest string of 1's on 7-segment displays {\it HEX}$1-0$, 
for the longest string of 0's on {\it HEX}$3-2$, and for 
alternating 1's and 0's on {\it HEX}$5-4$. 
The parallel port in the DE-series Computer connected to the 7-segment displays 
is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:HEX}.

~\\
\noindent
Create a new folder and Monitor Program project for your C program, and then compile,
download, and test the code. Using the ten words of test data shown above, the correct
result that should appear on the {\it HEX}$5-0$ displays is \red{\sf 32 31 12}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/figureHEX.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The parallel ports connected to the 7-segment displays {\it HEX}$5-0$.}
\label{fig:HEX}
\end{figure}

~\\
~\\
\noindent
{\bf Part IV}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
In Exercise 4 you were asked to implement a real-time clock. The
clock-time was shown on the {\it HEX}$3-0$ seven-segment displays in the format \red{SS}:\red{DD},
with \red{\it SS} representing seconds and \red{\it DD} representing hundredths of a second.
Time was measured in intervals of 0.01 seconds by using polled I/O with the A9 Private Timer, 
and the clock could be stopped/run by pressing one of the pushbutton {\it KEYs}.

~\\
\noindent
In this part of the exercise you are to write a C program that implements a real-time
clock. Display the clock-time on the 7-segment displays {\it HEX}$5-0$
in the format \red{MM}:\red{SS}:\red{DD}, where 
where \red{\it MM} are minutes, \red{\it SS} are seconds, and \red{\it DD} are hundredths of 
a second.  Measure time intervals of 0.01 seconds in your program by using polled I/O with the A9 
Private Timer.  You should be able to stop/run the clock by pressing any pushbutton {\it KEY}.
When the clock reaches \red{59}:\red{59}:\red{99}, it should wrap around to
\red{00}:\red{00}:\red{00}.

~\\
\noindent
Make a new folder to hold your Monitor Program project for this part. Create a
file called {\it part4.c} and type your C code into this file.  Make a new Monitor Program 
project for this part of the exercise, and then compile, download, and test your program. 

~\\
\noindent
{\bf Part V}
~\\
~\\
\noindent
Write a C program that scrolls a text message in the right-to-left direction across the 
7-segment displays {\it HEX}$5-0$. You can display any message of your choosing. As an
example, if the message were \red{\sf dE1-SoC}, then Table 1 shows what the displays would 
look like in each step as the message is scrolled. You should scroll the message at a rate of 
0.2 seconds per character. Allow the scrolling operation to stopped/run by pressing
any pushbutton {\it KEY}.

~\\
~\\
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[t]{12.5 cm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}
Time slot & \multicolumn{6}{c}{Display} \\
\hline
{\rule[0mm]{0mm}{5mm}0} &\red{d}&\red{E}&\red{1}&\red{-}&\red{S}&\red{o} \\ 
1 &\red{E}&\red{1}&\red{-}&\red{S}&\red{o}&\red{C}\\
2 &\red{1}&\red{-}&\red{S}&\red{o}&\red{C}& \\
3 &\red{-}&\red{S}&\red{o}&\red{C}& & \\
4 &\red{S}&\red{o}&\red{C}& & & \\
5 &\red{o}&\red{C}& & & & \\
6 &\red{C}& & & & & \\
7 & & & & & & \\
8 & & & & & &\red{d}\\
9 & & & & &\red{d}&\red{E}\\
$\ldots$ & & &$\ldots$ & &\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{center}
		  Table 1. Scrolling the message \red{\sf dE1-SoC} on {\it HEX}$5-0$.
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
~\\
~\\
~\\
\noindent
Note that scrolling a message across the 7-segment displays is similar in nature to the 
task of implementing a real-time clock, from Part IV. You should be able to reuse most of 
your code from Part IV. But instead of updating the clock each time the A9 Private Timer
expires, you need to update the scrolling message.  

~\\
\noindent
Make a new folder to hold your Monitor Program project for this part. Create a
file called {\it part5.c} and type your C code into this file.  Make a new Monitor Program 
project, compile, download, and test your program.
